" If you see this file, your homedir was just created on this workstation.

" got yourself a faster machine.
" Either way, the main goal of this configuration is to help you be more
" productive; if you have ideas, praise or complaints, direct them to
" vi-users@google.com (http://g/vi-users). We'd especially like to hear from you
" if you can think of ways to make this configuration better for the next
" Noogler.
